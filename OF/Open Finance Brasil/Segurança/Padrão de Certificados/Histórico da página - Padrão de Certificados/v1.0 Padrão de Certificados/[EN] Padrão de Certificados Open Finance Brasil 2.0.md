## 5. Open Finance Brasil Certificate Standards

### 5.1. Introduction

The Open Finance Brazil ecosystem makes use of chains of certificates and TLS protocol to guarantee the confidentiality, authentication and integrity of the communication channel used by the APIs of the participating organizations, as well as the customers of each of the participants.

The certificates used by Open Finance Brasil are also required to authenticate applications through oAuth 2.0 mTLS or private\_key\_jwt, in addition to being used to perform the payload signature using JWS. Another important attribution of certificates is to authenticate and present a secure channel to the end user in the act of authentication and use of services provided by the participating organizations.

### 5.2. ICP-Brasil Certificates

Certificates issued by Certifying Authorities authorized by ICP-Brasil are only used for communication between entities participating in the Open Finance Brasil ecosystem.

The certificate issuing and revocation processes are responsibility of the Certifate Authorities themselves, being regulated by Certification Practice Statements, and supervised by the Management Committee of the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (Comitê Gestor da Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas Brasileira).

The practices, processes, availability and values practiced by the Certification Authorities are not responsibility of the Initial Structure of Open Finance Brasil.

**Algorithms**

All certificates issued by ICP-Brasil must have the following characteristics:

- Type A of ICP-Brasil;
- Key Algorithms: RSA 2048 bits;
- Message Digest: SHA 256 bits.

**Participating Certificate Authorities**

The following certifying authorities carried out the onboard process for Open Finance Brasil and are authorized to issue Open Finance Brasil certificates using the level 1 certificates listed here:

- [CertiSign](https://www.gov.br/iti/pt-br/assuntos/repositorio/ac-certisign) (Chain v5 e v10)
- [Serasa](https://www.gov.br/iti/pt-br/assuntos/repositorio/ac-serasa-acp) (Chain v5 e v10)
- [Serpro](https://www.gov.br/iti/pt-br/assuntos/repositorio/ac-serpro-de-1deg-nivel) (Chain v5 e v10)
- [Soluti](https://www.gov.br/iti/pt-br/assuntos/repositorio/ac-soluti) (Chain v5 e v10)

Only the certificates indicated with "`Situação: válido`" (which mean "`status: valid`") in these ITI repositories referenced above, which are Chain v5 and v10, should be accepted by the servers of the Open Finance Brasil ecosystem.

#### 5.2.1. Server Certificate

The Server Certificate must be issued to protect and authenticate the TLS channel used by the APIs that will be consumed by client applications of organizations participating in Open Finance.

The certificate standard used must follow the existing certificate issuing practices of "CERTIFICATE FOR WEB SERVER - ICP-Brasil".

The server certificate shall be sent with the intermediate chain, according to [RFC5246](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/items%207.4.2).

#### 5.2.2. Client Certificate

Client Application Certificates (Transport) are used to authenticate the mTLS channel and to authenticate the client application through oAuth2.0 mTLS or private\_key\_jwt, according to the application registration performed by the Dynamic Client Registration process with the transmitting organization. Regarding mTLS, the client certificate shall be sent with the intermediate chain, according to [RFC5246](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/items%207.4.2%20and%207.4.6).

To issue a Client Certificate, the participating organization in Open Finance Brasil must register the application in the Directory Service through the Software Statement Assertion issue process, and thus have already obtained the Software Statement ID value.

##### 5.2.2.1. Open Finance Brasil Attributes

- **serialNumber:** National Register of Legal Personnel (CNPJ) of the legal entity holding the certificate and associated with the UID attribute and Software Statement ID, during validation with the Directory Service of Open Finance Brasil;

#### 5.2.4. Front-End Certificates

Front-End certificates are utilized to make services available, generally web pages, using TLS, that are acessible by the end users. Due to their function, and in order to guarantee better interoperability, those certificates must be of the type EV (Extended Validation) and must be generated by a valid certificate authority, following definitions of RFC 5280 e RFC 2818, in conformance with WebTrust principles and criteria.

#### 5.2.5. About certificates for exchanging information between authorized institutions and partners (non-participating)

According to section IV of Joint Resolution No. 1 of May 4, 2020, the establishment of bilateral partnerships between authorized institutions and partners is an arrangement provided for in the regulation which must observe, where applicable, the same standards and certificates requirements that are applicable to exchange of information between participating institutions.

In accordance with §2 of Art. 10 of Provisional Measure 2200-2 of August 24, 2001 and with the provisions of item 3.12 in BCB Normative Instruction No. 134, for bilateral communication between institutions and partners, the use is authorized, by mutual agreement between the parties, of a private PKI, provided that the requirements of this *profile for security certificates* are observed, including their formatting, algorithms and established attributes.

The values for filling in the attributes required in this specification, but not applicable to the partner, should be defined in common agreement between the authorized institution and the partner, which does not exempt the authorized institution from the responsibility for filling it in properly.

## 9. Open Finance Client Certificate Subject DN Pattern - After January 19, 2023 {#subjectDNtemplates}

On January 19, 2023 the sequence and encoding of the Subject DN used in Open Finance Client Certificates was standardized. Below is determined the sequence and coding of how the attributes of the certificates should be presented in the Subject DN.

The coexistence period between the different types of Subject DN must be considered, so the participants of the ecosystem should not implement blocking controls that limit the use of only certificates with the Subject DN standardized below. Participants must ensure that the other DN standards already in use continue to function until the end of the coexistence period, a date yet to be determined.

Special attention is required from the participants during the Subject DN generation process, as below are presented Subject DN and RDN formats. The Ecosystem expects the use of RDN in compliance with RFC4514.

When in doubt:

- check the JWKS of your `software-id` application
- check the KID of the certificate you want the Subject DN for, customize the URL and access: `https://keystore.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/<org-id>/<software-ID>/transport.jwks`

`Example: https://keystore.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/9c721898-9ce0-50f1-bf85-05075557850b/793c382e-edb1-4a64-b5c5-9e27366099b9/transport.jwks`

- search for the KID of the certificate, then search for Claim: x5dn

### 9.1. Public Key of Certificate Example:

## 1. Registering a Bank

### 1.1. Directory Overview

The trust framework services provided by Open Finance Brasil provide all of the discovery services necessary for a TPPs and ASPSPs to interact with each other without being required to validate the authenticity of each others Identity, Authorizations, Consumer Offerings (Apps), APIs or Credentials

An Authorization Server or AS as defined by [RFC 6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) perform several functions in a Data Sharing ecosystem like Open Finance. Please read ensure that the concepts roles and responsibilities defined in the original RFC are well understood before proceeding. In addition please ensure that the concepts, roles and responsibilities defined in [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) and how they extended the concepts defined in RFC 6749 are equally as well understood.

### 1.2. Registering an Authorization Server and OpenID Provider

Banks, typically large banks, will not be a single entity from a technology operations point of view. They may have different brands, security and IT infrastructure for different customer segments or they may have some IT infrastructure that supports multiple brands or customer segments. This means that the technical ecosystem needs to be flexible enough to support a wide variety of Banks Infrastructure Deployments whilst ensuring that the necessary services are discoverable both Third Parties customers that need to interact with it.

A flexible model for advertising authentication/authorization services and the resources that are protected by the AuthN and AuthZ is supported by the Directory.

- **Customer Friendly Name** - This is will be displayed to customers by TPPs and should be recognisable by the Banks Customers Already.
- **Customer Friendly Logo** - This will be displayed to customers by TPPs to aid brand recognition.
- **Description** - This may be displayed to customers by TPPs to aid brand recognition.
- **Terms of Service** - This is a link to the Banks Terms of Service which may be included by TPPs.
- **Notification WebHook** - Authorization Servers can register a WebHook that will receive pushed updates regarding changes to participants, their software or certificates.
- **OpenID Well Known Document Uri** - Link to the Authorization Server’s Discovery Document.

A Bank may choose to have one Authorization Server or many provided that it can satisfy the following requirements.

- A customer can recognise the Authorization Server as a place that they would normally Bank with.
- The Authorization Server can issue tokens for the resource and services that a customer or TPP is looking for.
- For transmiting/account holder institutions whose *Authorization Server* supports more than one brand, it must accept more than one registry (client\_ids creation) for the same *software statement*. If your *Authorization Server* implementation does not supports this behaviour, it must be suitable to support multiple brands and the registration of brands in the directory must be annotated according to each brand.

### 1.3. Registering Resources

Once a Bank has registered an Authorization Server, it needs to advertise what resources, APIs or Services it can provide authorization for.

| Auth Id | Auth Customer Friendly Name | Well Known | Resource | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Amazing Business Banking | [https://auth.business.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.business.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | consents | 1 |
| 1 | Amazing Business Banking | [https://auth.business.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.business.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | business account information | 1 |
| 1 | Amazing Business Banking | [https://auth.business.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.business.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | payments | 1 |
| 2 | Amazing Banking | [https://auth.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | consents | 1 |
| 2 | Amazing Banking | [https://auth.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | account information | 1 |
| 2 | Amazing Banking | [https://auth.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | account information | 2 |
| 3 | Amazing Banking | [https://auth.payments.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.payments.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | payments consents | 1 |
| 3 | Amazing Banking | [https://auth.payments.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://auth.payments.amazingbank.org.br/.well-known/openid-configuration) | payments | 1 |

In the above example, Amazing Banking is advertising two services that should be recognisable to customers. “Amazing Business Banking” and “Amazing Banking”. These **may or may not be** directly related to “Brands” as different Banks may need to advertise different authentication services even within a sub brand.

In addition the bank advertises what resources each of the Authorization Servers are protecting or offering. In the above example Amazing Banking is supporting both version 1 and version 2 of the account information API and that “Amazing Banking” has two separate authentication and authorization systems for Payments and Account Information .

Correctly advertising what resources are offered by each server is important to achieving the scale envisaged by Brasil Open Finance and critical for ensuring that customers can identify their banking service easily and that TPPs can route customers to the correct Authorization Service based on the resources that protected by each service.

## 2. Validating a client registration request

Using OpenID Connect Discovery and the Brasil Open Finance Dynamic Client Registration specification. A TPP can register their application at each of the Authorization Servers available in the ecosystem.
